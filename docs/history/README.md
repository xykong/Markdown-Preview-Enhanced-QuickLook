# History (Archived Documents)

This folder keeps older docs that are no longer the primary entry point but are retained so that historical context and past decisions remain discoverable.

## Structure

- `images/`: older image/path/base64 investigations and summaries
- `performance/`: older baselines, roadmaps, and plans
- `reorg/`: repo reorganization notes
- `lessons/`: postmortems / lessons learned
