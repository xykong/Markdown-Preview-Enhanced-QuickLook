# Docs Assets

Put marketing assets here so README can reference stable paths.

Recommended files:

- `demo.gif` (10 15s: Finder  Space  Mermaid/KaTeX/TOC)
- `demo-light.png`
- `demo-dark.png`
- `comparison.png` (optional)

Recording tips:

- Keep it under ~8MB if possible (GitHub renders faster)
- Use a real Finder QuickLook flow (select file  press Space)
- Include at least one shot that shows Mermaid + KaTeX + code highlighting
